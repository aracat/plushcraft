## G4 eye embroidery design

![](eye%20embroidery%20120mm/eyes.png) ![](eye%20embroidery%20120mm/embroidered.png)

This is an [inkstitch](https://www.inkstitch.org) compatible embroidery design for G4 pony eyes that's about as large as you can fit in a 4" / 120mm embroidery hoop.

These designs are for the standard three eyelash with oval shape eye, which is suitable for Pinkie, Rainbow, Starlight, most random background mares, and can be adapted to stallions by hiding the eyelashes.

Note these eyes are not symmetrical because the catchlights are in different places on either eye. Some people prefer one way or the other, and if you prefer them symmetrical, then pick whichever design and mirror the eye in the embroidery machine for the other side.

These designs are licensed under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). Please link back to here from your deviantArt/twitter/etc... post about the finished plush if possible.

Why are these on GitHub? Because deviantArt doesn't like the files I want to upload.

### Do you want to make a plush with these eyes?

Download the [left](eye%20embroidery%20120mm/left.pes) and [right](eye%20embroidery%20120mm/right.pes) .pes files. The left eye goes on the pony's left side, not your left side when looking at it or the pony's "left" (i.e. right) side before it's turned out.

Each eye design includes the following steps and will run in this order:

* a straight stitch around the perimeter of the eye to stick stabilizer down
* a ~1mm^2 underlay grid to bind the stabilizer to the fabric
* the sclera (whites) fill
* satin stitched iris (colorful part) with four distinct regions
    * lower iris
    * minor iris highlight (lightest)
    * major iris highlight (less light)
    * upper iris (darker)
* the pupil (black)
* catchlights (white ovals)
* the eyelashes (black)
* the stroke along the top of the eye (black)
* an alignment guide in bright red, which you'll want to skip

I happened to use blue-green colors for the iris. You can use different colors for each region, just keep track of which thread color goes where.

### Do you want to see how the design works or modify it for your needs?

Download the [.svg file](eye%20embroidery%20120mm/eyes.svg).

Some additional documentation for this design and hints for rendering it for your embroidery machine are included in the file itself.
