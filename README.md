* G4 eye embroidery design

This is an [inkstitch](https://www.inkstitch.org) compatible embroidery design for G4 pony eyes that's about as large as you can fit in a 4" / 120mm embroidery hoop.

Why here? Because deviantArt doesn't like the files I want to upload.

The documentation for this design and instructions for rendering the design for the machine is included in the file itself, however there are two pre-baked .pes files for either eye.
